# AI_Powered_Travel_Planner
## Hello folks! :grinning:
This Repository holds the implementation of PS of high prep SDE track IIT-BHU by group 4 
* The main repository directory (AI-Powered-Travel-Planner/) contains three major subdirectories: **frontend/**, **backend/**, and **ml/**
* Each subdirectory follows its own structure for organizing code, assets, and configurations.
* Within **frontend/**, the code is organized based on the React app structure with subdirectories for components, pages, assets, and styles.
    - **public/**: This directory contains public assets like the index.html file, which serves as the entry point of our React app.
    - **src/**: This is the main directory for our React code.
       - **index.js**: The entry point of our React app.
       - **App.js**: The main component of our app where you assemble other components and manage routing.
       - **components/**: Directory for reusable UI components.
       - **pages/**: Directory for different pages/screens of our app.
       - **assets/**: Directory for static assets like images.
       - **styles/**: Directory for global and component-specific styles.
* In **backend/**, the code follows a structure typical for backend development with subdirectories for routes, controllers, and models.
    - **src/**: The main directory for our backend code
       - **app.js**: The entry point of our backend application.
       - **routes/**: Directory for defining API routes. 
       - **controllers/**: Directory for handling business logic.
       - **models/**: Directory for database model.
* In **ml/**, the code is organized into separate files for different machine learning tasks (e.g., train delay prediction, flight price prediction) and relevant data and model storage directories.
    - **src/**: The main directory for your machine learning code.
       - **flight_price_prediction.py**: File for flight price prediction ML code.
    - **data/**: Directory for storing input data for ML models.
       - **Flight_prediction_data** provided in the PS have been uploaded in this directory. 
* The **.gitignore** files help to exclude unnecessary files and directories from version control.
